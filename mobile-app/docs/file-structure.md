## File Purposes and Responsibilities

### Core Files

**main.dart**

- App entry point
- Provider setup (AuthProvider, EventProvider, etc.)
- Stripe initialization
- MaterialApp with routing configuration

**core/config/app_config.dart**

- Environment variable management
- API URLs and configuration
- App constants and settings

**core/routes/app_router.dart**

- GoRouter configuration
- Route definitions and navigation
- Bottom navigation integration

**core/theme/app_theme.dart**

- Light and dark theme definitions
- Color schemes and typography
- Component styling (buttons, text fields, etc.)

### Feature-Based Architecture

Each feature follows the same structure:

**Models** (`models/`)

- Data classes with JSON serialization
- Business logic and computed properties
- Type-safe data representation

**Providers** (`providers/`)

- State management using Provider package
- API call coordination
- Loading and error state handling

**Screens** (`screens/`)

- UI components and layouts
- User interaction handling
- Provider consumption for data

**Services** (`services/`)

- HTTP API communication
- Data transformation
- Error handling and retry logic

### Global Services

**services/stripe_service.dart**

- Stripe SDK integration
- Payment intent creation
- Payment method handling
- Payment confirmation

### Common Widgets

**common_widgets/**

- Reusable UI components
- Consistent styling across the app
- Shared functionality (forms, buttons, navigation)
